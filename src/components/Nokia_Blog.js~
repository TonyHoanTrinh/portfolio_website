                    My name is Tony Hoan Trinh and from April 2020 - December 2020, I was a co-op student at Nokia Ottawa as a Project Management Assistant.
                    I am writing this to both inform and educate others about my experience being a co-op student at Nokia, the position itself and to document
                    my time there. I am also writing this for my own personal use as a blog/diary to keep the memories and stories of some of the work that I had 
                    done to look back and reflect in the future. I hope others can learn or take something away from my experience or at the very least
                    enjoy this blog post.

                    Nokia is a Finnish telecommunications company established in 1865 in Finland with headquarters in Espoo, Finland and branches across the world.
                    They are well known for their phones back in the 90s and early 2000's. Remember those indestructible Nokia phones?
                    The company still produces phones but shifted their main focus to telecommunications services across the world
                    for customers such as AT and T, Bell, Verizon etc. They are 1 of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world and are a leader in 5G and IOT technologies.
                    The current CEO is Pekka Lundmark but had other leaders in the past such as Jorma Ollila and Rajeev Suri.
                    In 2016, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent and acquired Bell Labs. Bell Labs is known for it's rich history of many inventions and patents such as
                    the Unix operating system and several programming languages such as C and C++. The research and scientific company was renamed to Nokia Bell Labs from
                    the acquisition.
                    There are many branches across the world owned by Nokia from US to places in India to Europe. The Nokia Ottawa branch I was working at had a focus on
                    software development used for their telecommunications services, network equipment and IOT technologies.

                    My co-op term was split into 2 sections, the first 4 months and the last 4 months.
                    In the first 4 months I was trained and mentored by the senior co-op student and in my last 4 months I became the mentor to 
                    the new junior co-op student incoming. 
                    I had many goals during my work term and had goals for both of the first 4 months and the last 4 months.
                    I wanted to develop goals that were related to my job tasks and goals that would push outside my comfort zone to learn new things.

                    </React.Fragment>

                    In the first months I was the junior co-op student and was mostly in the process of learning and integrating myself in the company.
                    I had soft skill goals of leadership and teamwork and I had hard skill goals such as improving my technical skill in web development 
                    (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), Excel and VBA Macros and Power BI.

                    <React.Fragment>
                        <br></br>
                    </React.Fragment>

                    I wanted to work on my leadership as I was going to be mentored by the senior co-op student but eventually I would become the mentor
                    to the new junior co-op student in my last 4 months, so I slowly learned to develop my leadership skills in taking more responsibilities
                    and running most of the meetings to the point where I was the one running the show.
                    In terms of teamwork I was going to be working remote and with many teammates from across the world. I wanted to make sure I worked on
                    my teamwork and communication skills. Such as having strong communication with my colleagues in terms of progress of work,
                    reaching out for help and helping them out with their tasks and talking to them regularly to build a strong bond of trust.
                    For my technical skills I got opportunities in the position to work on my web development skills. We had a documentation website
                    where we had to convert our old website to our new website, and I was helping the Senior Technical Officer with that and I got
                    a lot more experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the process. There were many other tasks related to Excel and VBA Macros
                    used by many of the Directors and Upper Level Managers which I had to both create and fix VBA macros for their use. I did use a lot of Excel
                    prior to the position however I wasn't as well versed in writing VBA macros, so I had to learn.
                    For the Power BI, I had to create a lot of business intelligence visualizations for upper management often to colleagues from Europe.
                    I did not have any experience in Power BI before, so I had to learn how to connect to a database through the application and create
                    interactive and compelling visualizations for the position. I definitely learned a lot about Power BI through this experience.

                    </React.Fragment>

                    In my last 4 months I became the senior co-op student and my goals became more focused to becoming a stronger mentor/leader and 
                    continuing my technical prowess and my soft skills. I had goals such as improving my suggestive advice for improvement, mentoring and 
                    teaching skills, database knowledge and implementation (MariaDB/MySQL) and expanding my interests to other opportunities provided by Nokia.
                    I had the goal of improving my suggestive advice for improvement and my higher level knowledge of the organization. Often times we get new technologies
                    available to use and Nokia provides many workshops that teach us how to use them. But it is up to us to adopt them for the purposes of our 
                    teams. In the last 4 months I wanted to improve the productivity of not just our team but our organization as well. Myself and another colleague
                    were suggesting a better medium of communication for our software teams as we realized that many of our teams were using a variety of different tools
                    and because it wasn't consolidated to a single or a few mediums it became difficult for many issues to be fixed by our software teams.
                    So I took it upon myself to attend more of the Nokia workshops to see what we had available in terms of communication software, and I was able
                    to build a report to suggest to our director to change the medium of communication which I think helped the productivity of our teams.
                    For my other goal of improving my mentoring skills. I already had some skills in teaching from my previous TA position, and so I already
                    had a bit of a background in teaching and being a mentor. But I wanted to improve on those skills and also provide a great experience to the
                    junior co-op student for their own learning and to make it easier for them as we were all remote. I made sure to have a lot of consistent meetings
                    with the student and also made sure to get them involved in all the tasks, so they would be comfortable doing them on their own and to eventually
                    teach the next student. During this, the student and I developed a strong bond of trust and reliability which led to a very productive work term for both of us.
                    During my last 4 months I had to implement a new database table for a certain task we were doing. I made a goal to improve my knowledge of databases
                    and the implementation of them using MySQL/MariaDB. I looked at some online courses provided by Nokia and worked with the Senior Software Engineer and we
                    were able to create a MySQL database and made sure to follow all the best database practices in terms of naming, typing and consistency. 
                    And for my last goal I wanted to work on some of the other opportunities provided by Nokia. I was able to work on a data analysis project provided
                    by another Nokia colleague from the US. They gave me some data and I did an analysis on it which helped them improve their logistics and business decisions.
                    I used R and Python for the analysis. I already had experience using R and Python from my previous URA however I was able to apply these skills in a different way than what I was used to
                    and learned a bit more about Machine Learning and data analysis on the way.

                    I learned a lot of skills as I stated above, and I know for sure that these skills will be very beneficial to me in my future work experience.
                    Soft skills will never go away and are often just as important if not more important than hard skills and during this time I was able to 
                    work on my soft skills considerably and improve them to a high degree. With my hard skills I learned a lot about Power BI, MySQL/MariaDB, VBA and Excel and
                    improve my existing knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R and Python.
                    I also got to work on the project management side of software development and learn out the structure of business at a high level.
                    I feel like combining those skills with my technical and soft skills is a very effective combination and will lead me to
                    major success in my future work.

                    During my work term I had to work with a variety of different technologies.
                    At my work we had our documentation website where we outlined guides for all of our internal software products.
                    This website was converted from our previous website and had to be regularly maintained and updated. With this I used
                    Markdown, CSS and JavaScript for this documentation.
                    I would also work on many Excel sheets and this often involved running, creating and fixing VBA macros.
                    We had a lot of Excel sheets used for documenting and auditing purposes and these macros were important for improving
                    the accuracy and productivity of our work.
                    There were also a lot of business intelligence (BI) visualizations that had to be created for use by a lot of our senior managers.
                    I created these BI visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and had to use data supplied by our database.
                    Our database was implemented using MySQL/MariaDB and I would regularly maintain this database manually through queries or through the use of Perl/Python scripts
                    ran through our Red Hat Linux VM.
                    Nokia also provided a lot of opportunities to expand my learning and get involved in other tasks, and I was able to work on
                    a data analysis project with a colleague from the US. I used R and Python for data analysis on data provided
                    by this colleague for improving employee engagement.
                    In addition, I used a lot of tools that are often used in the software development world such as Git, Bash Scripting, JIRA, SonarQube
                    etc.

                    </React.Fragment>

                    I had quite a few goals that I listed above, and I felt like I was very successful in completing those goals. I made sure my goals
                    aligned with my job tasks, made sure they were obtainable and designed my goals to be useful for my future work experience. Nokia provided a lot of 
                    opportunities for me to work on those skills and during the 8 months I learned a lot and achieved a lot during that time.

                    For the Project Management Assistant position at the Nokia Ottawa branch I was tasked with a lot of tasks. I had daily tasks involving documenting,
                    auditing and dealing with tickets. On a weekly basis I had to make sure our scripts, database and Power BI visualizations were working properly.
                    I also had monthly tasks where I worked on a variety of different tasks such as working on the documentation website and building new Power BI reports.
                    I would also get tasked with other objectives that involved VBA and Excel, JIRA, attending meetings with leads to get input and feedback, data analysis using
                    R and Python etc.
                    A lot of those skills I had already previous learned from my coursework and previous work experience such as with web development and data analysis but I had
                    to learn a lot of new things as well such as with databases and Power BI.
                    There were a lot of meetings that I attended with directors, managers, VPs and other co-op students and I felt very connected to the company being a part of those.
                    I got a lot of opportunities to work with the project management side of things and learned a lot about
                    how software projects are initialized, created, designed and implemented and all the information associated with them.
                    I learned a lot about how products and projects are maintained and documented as well and a high level overview of how software businesses work.

                    In my last 8 months, I learned a lot. The position teaches you a wide range of different skills from soft skills such as teamwork, cooperation and leadership to
                    hard skills such as web development, business intelligence, databases and data analysis. It also teaches you a lot about how businesses work and
                    how products are created and how projects are managed. You get to work and talk with a wide variety of people from developers to directors.
                    This was a very valuable position and I recommend it for anyone who has interest in both the business and tech side of things as you get to 
                    work and interact with a wide variety of different people and aspects of a tech company.
                    The company Nokia wants you to succeed and everyone there is willing to help you and make you become the best person that you could be. 
                    The culture and work environment is both friendly and helpful but also still wanting to push you to become better and smarter with your work.
                    I will always appreciate this opportunity and never forget this experience.

                    I would like to thank my colleagues at Nokia Ottawa for giving me this great co-op opportunity over my Summer and Fall terms.
                    Not only that, but I would also like to thank the Co-op counselors (Laura and Kate) and my program counselor (Greg) at the University of Guelph for helping me with my resume and 
                    co-op search and always being supportive and helpful.
