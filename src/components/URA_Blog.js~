                Hi,

                Welcome to my first blog post! My name is Tony Hoan Trinh and during the summer term of April 2019 - August 2019 I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph. I wish to write this blog to keep it as a memory of my experience to look back on. I hope anyone who reads this will find it informative or at the very least entertaining. So without further ado, let's begin!

                The Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph is responsible for making business decisions on University and Student data and trends. I was working for this department under the head Statistician where I was writing R and Python code to do data analysis and building machine learning models to perform predictions.
                
                Going into the position I knew I was going to be writing mostly R and Python code and I had some prior knowledge of both languages from course work and my own personal use but not that much. I wanted to make 1 of my goals to be more proficient in the R and Python languages.
                
                I was also going into the position knowing that I was not going to be just working with the head Statistician but with other people such as the director and manager and other colleagues in the department, and so I wanted to make cooperation as another 1 of my goals.

                </React.Fragment>

                During the 4 months, I definitely got alot experience in R and Python as I was doing data analysis and building models every day. I also learned a bit of SAS as well. My mentor the head Statistician was incredibly helpful during the time there and gave me a lot of advice, guidance and also resources to help supplement my learning of data science. I learned a lot about data consistency, cleaning and a lot of statistical methods and machine learning models during that time.

                In addition the environment there was very kind and helped me feel comfortable during my time there which helped my learning as everyone was very encouraging. I felt like I accomplished my goals. I learned a lot about cooperation and working in a professional environment such as with the meetings with the rest of the team and cooperating on projects. And I learned so much about data science and R and Python throughout my time there. 
                
                In the position of an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph, I got to work in a professional environment and perform data analysis and built machine learning models on University and Student data using R and Python. I learned a lot about working with other professional colleagues on projects and a lot about data science and statistics and coding in the R and Python languages.

                In my 4 months during the Summer of 2019 as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I learned so much and had an amazing time doing so. As I stated above I learned so much about data science and statistics and the languages used in those fields through my mentor and I was given a lot of advice and guidance from my other colleagues at the department. 

                I would recommend anyone who wants to get some work experience to get their feet wet by being involved as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for their University. University always have many opportunities available, and they want you to learn and succeed. 

                I felt like I grew a lot during my time here and learned a lot. Not just about data science and technical skills but just working and being involved in something bigger than just course work.
                
                I had a great experience here and would totally recommend everyone to try to be an Undergraduate Research Assistant at least 1 point in their University career!

                Thank you so much to Kieran Shah of the Institutional Analysis and Research department for being an amazing mentor during my time there and the rest of the department for providing such a valuable and fun experience. We also got to experience the Toronto Raptors championship together during this time and I will never forget this summer!
