## Portfolio Website 2021

This is my Portfolio Website for 2021 built using React and Tailwind CSS.
The website is hosted on Github Pages (ala the gh-pages branch) and the code is on the master branch.

The website can be found at https://tonyhoantrinh.github.io/portfolio_website/

To deploy the website locally, you can git clone the master branch and then run:

<ol>
  <li> npm install (may have to run with --legacy-peer-deps) </li>
  <li> npm start </li>
<ol/>
