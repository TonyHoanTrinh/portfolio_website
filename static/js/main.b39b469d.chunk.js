Going into the position I knew I was going to be writing mostly R and Python code and I had some prior knowledge of both languages from course work and my own personal use but not that much. I wanted to make 1 of my goals to be more proficient in the R and Python languages. I was also going into the position knowing that I was not going to be just working with the head Statistician but with other people such as the director and manager and other colleagues in the department, and so I wanted to make cooperation as another 1 of my goals.",Object(u.jsxs)(o.a.Fragment,{children:[Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),Object(u.jsx)("br",{})]}),"During the 4 months, I definitely got alot experience in R and Python as I was doing data analysis and building models every day. I also learned a bit of SAS as well. My mentor the head Statistician was incredibly helpful during the time there and gave me a lot of advice, guidance and also resources to help supplement my learning of data science. I learned a lot about data consistency, cleaning and a lot of statistical methods and machine learning models during that time. In addition the environment there was very kind and helped me feel comfortable during my time there which helped my learning as everyone was very encouraging. I felt like I accomplished my goals. I learned a lot about cooperation and working in a professional environment such as with the meetings with the rest of the team and cooperating on projects. And I learned so much about data science and R and Python throughout my time there. In the position of an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph, I got to work in a professional environment and perform data analysis and built machine learning models on University and Student data using R and Python.

I would recommend anyone who wants to get some work experience to get their feet wet by being involved as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for their University. University always have many opportunities available, and they want you to learn and succeed. I felt like I grew a lot during my time here and learned a lot. Not just about data science and technical skills but just working and being involved in something bigger than just course work. I had a great experience here and would totally recommend everyone to try to be an Undergraduate Research Assistant at least 1 point in their University career!

It also covers Unix (mostly Debian), make files, basic Bash/Unix commands and basic information on how computers work. It was a lectured course taught by Professor Deb Stacey. I was a TA for the course and I was working with a small group of other TA's as well. We had a few responsibilities that each of us was responsible for doing. We were in charge of running labs where the students had to write small projects and were marked during the end of the lab.

Marking was probably my least favorite part of the position but it was still good and most of the students did very well which made it easier for me to mark.

In terms of teamwork I was going to be working remote and with many teammates from across the world. I wanted to make sure I worked on my teamwork and communication skills. Such as having strong communication with my colleagues in terms of progress of work, reaching out for help and helping them out with their tasks and talking to them regularly to build a strong bond of trust. For my technical skills I got opportunities in the position to work on my web development skills. We had a documentation website where we had to convert our old website to our new website, and I was helping the Senior Technical Officer with that and I got a lot more experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the process. There were many other tasks related to Excel and VBA Macros used by many of the Directors and Upper Level Managers which I had to both create and fix VBA macros for their use. I did use a lot of Excel prior to the position however I wasn't as well versed in writing VBA macros, so I had to learn. For the Power BI, I had to create a lot of business intelligence visualizations for upper management often to colleagues from Europe.

I had goals such as improving my suggestive advice for improvement, mentoring and teaching skills, database knowledge and implementation (MariaDB/MySQL) and expanding my interests to other opportunities provided by Nokia. I had the goal of improving my suggestive advice for improvement and my higher level knowledge of the organization. Often times we get new technologies available to use and Nokia provides many workshops that teach us how to use them. But it is up to us to adopt them for the purposes of our teams. In the last 4 months I wanted to improve the productivity of not just our team but our organization as well. Myself and another colleague were suggesting a better medium of communication for our software teams as we realized that many of our teams were using a variety of different tools and because it wasn't consolidated to a single or a few mediums it became difficult for many issues to be fixed by our software teams. So I took it upon myself to attend more of the Nokia workshops to see what we had available in terms of communication software, and I was able to build a report to suggest to our director to change the medium of communication which I think helped the productivity of our teams. For my other goal of improving my mentoring skills. I already had some skills in teaching from my previous TA position, and so I already had a bit of a background in teaching and being a mentor. But I wanted to improve on those skills and also provide a great experience to the junior co-op student for their own learning and to make it easier for them as we were all remote. I made sure to have a lot of consistent meetings with the student and also made sure to get them involved in all the tasks, so they would be comfortable doing them on their own and to eventually teach the next student. During this, the student and I developed a strong bond of trust and reliability which led to a very productive work term for both of us. During my last 4 months I had to implement a new database table for a certain task we were doing. I made a goal to improve my knowledge of databases and the implementation of them using MySQL/MariaDB. I looked at some online courses provided by Nokia and worked with the Senior Software Engineer and we were able to create a MySQL database and made sure to follow all the best database practices in terms of naming, typing and consistency. And for my last goal I wanted to work on some of the other opportunities provided by Nokia. I was able to work on a data analysis project provided by another Nokia colleague from the US. They gave me some data and I did an analysis on it which helped them improve their logistics and business decisions. I used R and Python for the analysis.
